Home Assistant is the best smart home solution - in my opinion.

But, if your family enjoys the convenience of a smart home solution, than availability becomes crucial. In addition, security and functionality will be enhanced by additional software solutions. 

Unfortunately, Home Assistant doesn't feature any kind of high availability. And, HASS and HA Add-Ons doesn't solve all issues from updating and harding the whole environment.

Therefore, a lot of people started projects to provide a solution for Home Assistant High Availability and/or Multi Software Environments:
* Home Assistant High Availability with Docker Swarm - https://github.com/cvb941/HAHA
* Home Assistant High Availability with Linbit DRBD, Pacemaker, Corosync, and Docker (published: June 18, 2024) - https://linbit.com/blog/home-assistant-high-availability/
* Home Assistant High Availability with Kubernetes Distribution K3s - https://jaygould.co.uk/2024-01-01-setting-up-home-assistant-kubernetes-k3s/
