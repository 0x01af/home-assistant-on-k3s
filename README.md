Home Assistant is the best smart home solution - in my opinion.

But, if your family enjoys the convenience of a smart home solution, than availability becomes crucial.

Unfortunately: Home Assistant doesn't feature any kind of high availability. Especially, if you enhance Home Assistant with additional software addons, you need an advanced environment.
